# stationmaster
Software for running a ham radio station

A few notes:
1. I am building this as a single user local application
2. It is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi as the station controller
3. It also depends on specific hardware such as key paddle, oscillator and amplifier
4. It has long running programs (e.g. the keyer and key tutor)

The keyer, code tutor is functional at this point.
